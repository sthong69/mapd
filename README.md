This project implements all classes used in a Petri Network.

## Installation

Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) to clone the repository. Make sure to have both [JDK](https://www.oracle.com/fr/java/technologies/downloads/) and [JUnits](https://junit.org/junit5/) installed (using an IDE such as Eclipse is recommended).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sthong69/codecamp-g1.git
```

## Usage

All methods used to create a PetriNet along with the elements inside it such as Places, Arcs and Transitions are implemented in the PetriNet class.
User can run methods by writing them inside the main method at the end of the class.

All tests are made using JUnit 5. Running all the tests to check the coverage is done by right-clicking on the project listed in the "Package Explorer", hovering "Coverage as..." and clicking on JUnit Test.
